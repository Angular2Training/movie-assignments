==============================================

> ## Extend the movie detail component so you can edit the properties of a movie and reflect it back to the model

**Steps**:
- Add two input fields of type `text` (name and genre) to the movie-detail component template and one of type `number` (rating).
- The `NgModel` directive is exported from the `FormsModule` located in `@angular/forms`. Add this module to the `imports` array of the movies module.
- Use the `ngModel` directive to two way bind the inputs to the name, genre and rating properties of the movie object.
> The `ngModel` directive is exported from the `FormModule` and can be used as syntactic sugar for 'two way binding' with input elements.
- Add the `FormsModule` located in `@angular/forms` to the `imports` array of the movies module.
> Test it in the browser and see what happens. 
- *testing testing.. wtf..?*
> Oops, we don't want the changes to directly be reflected in the movie list as well, so we need to decouple its model.
- In the movies component, use the `Object.assign` function to set the `selectedMovie` property to a clone of the clicked movie (event).

**Extra**:
- As an **extra** functionality, we want to clear the `genre` input when the user presses the escape button

**Result**:
> We are now able to reflect the user input to the model and vice versa via two way binding and the ngModel directive
