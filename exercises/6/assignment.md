Assignment 6: Retreiving data with a service
==============================================

## Create a service that returns/fetches the movie data instead of hardcoding it in the component

- Create a new service in the `movies` folder using the angular-cli command `ng g service movies/movie`;
  - Angular-cli will throw a warning that you must provide the service in order to use it;
  - Provide the new movie service in the `providers` array of our app module;
- Create a public function `getMovies` in our new movie service which will return the `movies` array as previously defined in our app component;
- Inject the `MovieService` in the constructor of the app component as a private property `movieService`;
- Import the `OnInit` interface in our app component and add the interface on the class `AppComponent` declaration;
  - Implement the interface by adding the `ngOnInit` method
- Retreive the movies in the `ngOnInit` function from the `movieService`, and assign it to our `movies` property;
- Needless to say, remove the hardcoded movies array from the app component. This array is now fetched with the service.

The movies will now be retreived from a reusable singleton service. The service is responsible of fetching and returning the requested movies.
How the service does that is not important to the components that use it.
