- [angular ngFor directive](https://angular-2-training-book.rangle.io/handout/directives/ng_for_directive.html)

**Steps**:
- Declare a public property in the app component `movies` and give it the typing array of any `any[]`;
- Initialize the movies array in the constructor as an array of movie objects;
  - Fill the array with a couple of good movies;
  - A movie object has the following properties: id, name, genre, rating;
- Create an unordered list `<ul>` in the template of the app component;
- Create one list item in the list `<li>` and use an `*ngFor` to loop over the movies;
  - Display the name and rating for each movie using interpolation;

**Result**:
> We now have a component that displays a list of movies.
